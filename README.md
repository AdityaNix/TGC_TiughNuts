## Tomato Rev


In 2023, India witnessed a tomato crisis due to erratic weather patterns, including unseasonal rainfall and prolonged droughts in key growing regions. This led to a drastic reduction in tomato yields, resulting in unprecedented price surges. Concurrently, widespread pest and disease outbreaks inflicted further losses on farmers. The shortage rippled across industries dependent on tomatoes, affecting food processing and condiment production. Consumers faced inflated prices and scarcity. This crisis highlighted the urgency of resilient agricultural practices and the need to address climate change's impact on India's vital agricultural sector. It was a stark reminder of the sector's vulnerability and the imperative for adaptive measures.

“Tomato Rev” is an innovative WebApp that connects farmers, consumers, and warehouses in a single chain and provides additional features like weather updates, smart banking aids, government policies, and more!
